🎯 Objective:
Build a backend API system to manage users, projects, and tasks. The API includes:

Task dependencies

Status workflows

Logical constraints like circular dependency detection

RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations

🔧 Technology Stack:
Layer	Technology
Backend	Python (Flask)
ORM	SQLAlchemy
Migration	Flask-Migrate + Alembic
Database	MySQL (via PyMySQL)
Tools	Postman for API testing

📁 Modules & Features:
1. Users Module
Add new users with name and email.

List all users.

Retrieve individual user by ID.

Validation for correct email format.

2. Projects Module
Create new projects.

List all projects.

Get details of a specific project.

View all tasks associated with a project.

3. Tasks Module
Create tasks under a specific project.

Assign tasks to a user.

Track task status (pending, in-progress, completed).

Add dependencies between tasks.

List tasks by user or by status.

Prevent marking a task as "completed" until dependencies are completed.

Prevent circular dependencies.

🔍 Logical Constraints Implemented:
Constraint Type	Description
✅ Dependency Check	A task can't be marked completed if its dependencies are not completed.
🔁 Circular Dependency Prevention	When adding dependencies, loops are automatically detected and blocked.
🔒 User Deletion Protection	(Optional logic) Prevent user deletion if assigned to pending/in-progress tasks.

📬 REST API Endpoints Summary:

GET	/users/	List users
GET	/users/<id>	Get user by ID
Projects	POST	/projects/	Create project
GET	/projects/	List projects
GET	/projects/<id>	Get project by ID
GET	/projects/<id>/tasks	List tasks for a project
Tasks	POST	/tasks/	Create task
GET	/tasks/<id>	Get task by ID
PUT	/tasks/<id>/status	Update task status
GET	/tasks/user/<user_id>	Tasks assigned to user

✅ Sample Use Case:
Admin adds users: Alice, Bob

Admin creates project: “Website Redesign”

Admin creates tasks:

“Design wireframes” → assigned to Alice

“Implement frontend” → assigned to Bob, depends on wireframes

“Deploy to staging” → depends on frontend

As Alice and Bob complete their tasks, dependencies are checked before updating statuses.
